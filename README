This set of Java code is based off of exercises from the book: "Learn Java the Hard Way" by Graham Mitchell.

I've included comments in some of the code to highlight what the code is intended to focus on, mainly being 
the fundamentals of Java.

I've found Mitchell's method of teaching Java to be very useful, so if the code seems interesting and you'd like to
brush up on the basics, give the book a try.
